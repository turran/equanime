Now that enesim is near a release, eix is fixed now to work without ecore
and we have eshm with posix segments working nice too it is about time to
retake this development as it was one of the first ones, and I still want
to finish it.

The idea is to have:
A server and a client library
A library for equanime itself. The server should link against it. This is done
because at the end it might be interesting to have a way for users to use the lib
directly

For backends we need
1. FB
2. SDL
3. X?
4. finally the embedded devices

All the logic is almost there, but needs to get in sync with newer code
