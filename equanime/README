Equanime aims to be a simple hardware based graphics library for embedded 
devices.

It might be very similar to what DirectFB is, but without many policies implemented
inside. For example equanime won't have any concept of window manager or surface
allocator, not even input devices; just a graphics abstraction layer. This was
what I expected from DirectFB years ago when it first started, but then it
followed the same X11 errors: monolithic (which are now "solved" on Xorg).
