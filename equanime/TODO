+ Move the modules code into a common place outside equanime
+ Make more functions for the modules (beside init and shutdown) to get
  the description of the layers or the controllers or whatever so a gui
  can be built on top of this to select devices / ouputs / inputs, etc. Or
  maybe define a xml file for each controller/layer/whatever.
+ Add the API to retreive memory surfaces from the controller, something like
  a surface allocator.
