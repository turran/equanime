Equanime is a server which abstracts the video hardware (colorspace conversion, resizer, display controller, capture, etc) and provides a simple IPC API that allows several clients to use that hardware.

This project hosts three different projects which are the core of equanime:
  * Equanime: Equanime itself
  * Eshm: A SHM server
  * Eix: An IPC library
